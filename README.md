Assignment Description
CS290 Course Project

In this project, you need to use HTML/CSS and JavaScript to build a simple website and publish it online. You can build a personal website for yourself, or a website of a small business or organization like a farm, a restaurant, a park, a hotel, a baseball club, or a website of some tutorials, showing skills that you have expertise in and want to share with others. You have a lot of freedom to determine the details of your website as long as you meet the requirements.  The theme doesn’t need to be real. Be creative! You will have three weeks (w6-w8) to work on this project. 

 
Requirements:

- The webpages should be presentable as a whole; the interface should be user friendly (text should be easy to read).
The website should contain pictures and/or videos, and they should be presentable as well (placed in a proper place, easy to see, have proper size and resolution).
- Website has 1 homepage and at least 3 subpages; the homepage and subpages have a horizontal menu that leads to the other pages. This means 4 total pages will be required.
- The homepage has picture carousel animation (slideshow effect, for example, pictures in this page http://oregonstateparks.org/ (Links to an external site.)). This needs to autoscroll and have forward and back buttons.
- Have a scroll box in one page. You can put text only or text with pictures inside the scroll box.  The scroll box should have something like a scroll bar to allow users rolling it up and down. 
- One page has a form either submit via get or post (enter the email and subscribe, a short survey, etc.)  You can set it to be submitted to http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~zhangluy/tools/class-content/form_tests/check_request.php (Links to an external site.) or your own link as long as it is working.
- One page has unordered HTML list with several entries. The horizontal menu does not count for this requirement.
- There is one button to download files (map to the farm, menu in the restaurant, a personal CV, etc.) The downloaded file can either open in the browser or download to the local computer.
- There is a link that you can click and leads to outside webpages (LinkedIn, Yelp, email, etc.)
- You are allowed to add other features not listed above to your website as long as they are functional and serve some purpose in your website.
- You should use at least HTML/CSS and JavaScript in your project.
 

Things to keep in mind:
- You need to search online or read books to learn the skills you need for this project by yourself. You are allowed to use other existing APIs (like Bootstrap for CSS) for your project.  If you are not sure about certain resources, ask us on Piazza.
- You are not permitted to use frameworks such as Angular and React.
- There are a lot of website templates online. You can learn some features or settings from these templates, but you can’t copy the whole templates and use it as your own project.
- Many website functions rely on the database access which will be taught in CS340. We will touch it a little bit in week 9.
